Just Another Repo

Ok so this is my first commit and the tutorial has asked me to write a little something about myself, so here it goes. My name is Lui im 26 years old and live in Sweden I dont know much about coding except an unfinished tutorial or two on codeacademy. I love the idea of coding but have never fully commited to much in life. What I think I really need is something to lead me in the write direction. As many coders out there know, there are so many branches in coding and its hard as a beginner to know what suits you or what you are actually even intrested in. Trying to balance it as a career as well as a hobby, trying profit from it whilst maintaining a passion and drive to be better all the while maintaining an intresting to keep it a chore from developing further. Im unsure if this is public and will ever be read because I certainly wont broadcast it, but if anyone ever does get read I welcome anyone providing me with suggestions or a helping hand

Ok So this is an update that im using to test on the branch system that GitHub uses
